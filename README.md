# ODE_Solver
Estimates the derivatives of 4 relatively simple Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), using Euler’s, Heun’s, and Runge-Kutta’s Taylor expansions, with the support of an analytical solution, the program can calculate an absolute error, relative error, and can attempt to quantize Loss of Significant Figures (LOS) in terms of its Catastrophic Cancellation (CC).


 This program output estimates the derivatives of 4 relatively simple Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), using Euler’s, Heun’s, and Runge-Kutta’s Taylor expansions, with the support of an analytical solution, the program can calculate an absolute error, relative error, and can attempt to quantize Loss of Significant Figures (LOS) in terms of it’s Catastrophic Cancellation (CC).
 
### Instructions:
1. First, the user picks a choice of one of the four ODEs (a,b,c,d (lowercase)) 
2. Next, the user manually enters the analytical solution.
3. The next input is the initial value for x, in the form x(t0).
4. After that, the next two options are [a,b]: I decided to have b the first argument and a the 	second.
5. Lastly, you can choose the step size (sub-intervals), N.
